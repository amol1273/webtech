#The variance measures how much the data points are spread out
#from the mean. A higher variance indicates that the data points
#are more spread, while a lower variance indicates they are closer to the mean.
#The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.
#It tells us how much the data deviates, on average, from the mean.
