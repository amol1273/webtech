#The Radial Basis Function (RBF) is a popular kernel used in Support Vector Machines (SVM) and other machine learning algorithms.
#It measures the similarity between data points in a non-linear manner.

#The gamma parameter is specific to the RBF kernel and determines the influence of a single training example on the decision boundary.
# kernel is a function that computes the similarity (or inner product) between two data points in a transformed feature space.
#It allows SVM to perform non-linear classification by mapping input data into higher-dimensional space without explicitly calculating the coordinates in that space
