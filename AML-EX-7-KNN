#K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression.
#It classifies a data point based on how its neighbors are classified.

#The accuracy score measures the performance of a classification model by checking
#the percentage of correct predictions over the total predictions.
